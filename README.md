I’m a scrappy and ambitious software engineer focused on making open-source more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. I previously worked at IBM Watson, the Boston Consulting Group, and most recently Netflix. 

<!--Across my work, I find great joy using software to generate insights through good code and radical open-mindedness. If I’m not coding, I’m most likely at the gym, spending time with family, or learning how to build robots (specifically, self driving 🚗.)
