I’m a software engineer focused on creating technology to elevate people and building community. I previously worked at the Boston Consulting Group, Netflix, and Tempus Labs. Today, I'm part of DoorDash!

<!--Across my work, I find great joy using software to generate insights through good code and radical open-mindedness. If I’m not coding, I’m most likely at the gym, spending time with family, or learning how to build robots (specifically, drones or self driving 🚗.)
